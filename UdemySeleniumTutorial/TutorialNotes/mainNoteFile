one test case = one java class
driver.close();     //close current browser window
driver.quit();       //close all browser windows - useful when dealing with child windows - quit driver
if user clicks on a link to open a new window - it is a child window
select dropdowns always static
dynamic dropdowns -if there is more than one element with same xpath and want to choose one other than the first -
use indexes  -

                (//a[@value='MAA'])[2]                                            

                OR

use parent child relationship XPath -   

                - parent XPath<space>child Xpath     

                  example - //div[@id='ctl00_mainContent_ddl'] //a[@value='GOI'] 

     

Implicit Wait - wait for n number of seconds before throw an exception (declared globally - apply to each and every step) - it keeps listening to DOM and stop waiting when element found.
  Ex- driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS);



Explicit wait - only applicable to the specific step it declared for  -it keeps listening to DOM and stop waiting when element found. 
   Ex- w.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfAllElementsLocatedBy (By.cssSelector( "span.promoInfo")));

                                                  

Thread.sleep() - not selenium - wait exactly n number of seconds - it doesn't keep listening to DOM and stop waiting when element found.
Fluent wait - it doesn't keeps listening to DOM, only look for element in predefined intervals  and stop waiting when element found.
